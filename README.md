## AJAX ✏️
- stands for Aysnchronus Javascript And XML
- is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- is a web browser technology independent of web server software
- updates a web page without reloading the page
- requests data from a server - after the page has loaded
- receives data from a server - after the page has loaded
- sends data to a server - in the background 

## My AJAX Workflow  ✨
✔️ First, I will open a web page as usual with a synchronous request.

✔️ Next, I will click on a DOM element usually either a button or link which initiates an asynchronous request to the back-end server. 

✔️ I will not notice this, since the call is made asynchronously and doesn’t refresh the browser. 

✔️ In response to my AJAX request, the server may return XML, JSON, or HTML string data.

✔️ I parsed the response data using JavaScript/JQuery.

✔️ This parsed data is updated in the web page's DOM like magic

✔️ My web page now is updated with real-time data from the server without the browser reloading and without my knowledge.✌️
